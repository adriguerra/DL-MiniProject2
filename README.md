# EE-559 Deep Learning: Mini-Project 2

The objective of this project is to design a mini “deep learning framework” using only PyTorch’s
tensor operations and the standard math library. In particular, without using autograd or the
neural-network modules.

The framework provides the necessary tools to:
 - build networks combining fully connected layers, Tanh, and ReLU
 - run the forward and backward passes
 - optimize parameters with SGD for MSE.
